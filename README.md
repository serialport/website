# Node SerialPort Website

Working with serial ports can be hard, this is a collection of docs that make it easier.

> Go to https://serialport.io/ to learn more, find guides and api documentation.

## Documentation Strategy

To provide api docs, guides and explanations to make using serial ports easier.

Versioned docs are for major versions of serialport and should be kept up to date with the latest version of the package.

New docs should be added to the `/docs` directory. Edit the versioned docs too if correcting mistakes.

### Developing Docs

You can develop the docs by running with node v18

```bash
npm run start
```

And build them by running

```bash
npm run build
```

Note: Search doesn't work in development mode

Docs are automatically built with [vercel](https://www.vercel.com/) including previews on branches. The master branch is deployed to https://serialport.io

Cutting a new release will copy `next` to a version number.

```bash
npm run docusaurus docs:version 10.x.x
```
