Working with serial ports can be hard, this is a collection of docs that make it easier.

> Go to https://serialport.io/ to learn more, find guides and api documentation.

### Documentation Strategy
To provide api docs, guides and explanations to make using serial ports easier.

Versioned docs are for major versions of serialport and should be kept up to date with the latest version of the package.

New docs should be added to the `/docs` directory.

### Developing Docs

You can develop the docs by running

```bash
npm run start
```

And build them by running
```bash
npm run build
```

Note: Search doesn't work in development mode, neither does asciinema

Docs are automatically built with [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/pricing/) including previews on branches. The master branch is deployed to https://serialport.io
