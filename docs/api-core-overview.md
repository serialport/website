The `Binding` is how Node-SerialPort talks to the underlying system. By default, we auto-detect Windows, Linux and OS X, and load the appropriate module for your system. You can assign `SerialPort.Binding` to any binding you like. Find more bindings by searching ["serialport-binding" at npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=serialport-binding).

You can prevent auto-loading of the default bindings by requiring the [SerialPort Stream](api-stream.md) package.

```js
var SerialPort = require('@serialport/stream');
SerialPort.Binding = MyBindingClass;
```

You never have to use `Binding` objects directly. `@serialPort/stream` uses them to access the underlying hardware. This documentation is geared towards people who are making bindings for different platforms. The `AbstractBinding` class from the [`@serialport/binding-abstract`](.md) package can be inherited to get the base API.

There is also a [`MockBinding`](api-binding-mock.md) package to assist with testing.

To see the binding api take a look at [`@serialport/bindings-interface`](api-bindings-interface.md).
