### `openOptions`
```ts
export interface OpenOptions<T extends BindingInterface> extends BindingOpenOptions {
  /**
   * The hardware access binding. `Bindings` are how Node-Serialport talks to the underlying system. If you're using the `serialport` package, this defaults to `'@serialport/bindings-cpp'` which auto detects Windows (`WindowsBinding`), Linux (`LinuxBinding`) and OS X (`DarwinBinding`) and load the appropriate module for your system.
   */
  binding: T

  /** Automatically opens the port defaults to true*/
  autoOpen?: boolean

  /**
   * The size of the read and write buffers defaults to 64k
   */
  highWaterMark?: number

  /**
   * Emit 'end' on port close defaults false
   */
  endOnClose?: boolean
}
```

### `openCallback`
```ts
type openCallback = (Error|null) = {}
```

Called after a connection is opened. If this is not provided and an error occurs, it will be emitted on the port's `error` event. The callback will NOT be called if `autoOpen` is set to `false` in the `openOptions` as the open will not be performed.


```js
const serialport = new SerialPort({ path: '/dev/foo-bar', baudRate: 9600, autoOpen: false })
```
