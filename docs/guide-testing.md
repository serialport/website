Testing is an important feature of any library. To aid in our own tests we've developed a [`MockBinding`](api-binding-mock) a fake hardware binding that doesn't actually need any hardware to run. This class passes all of the same tests as our hardware based bindings and provides a few additional test related interfaces.

```ts
const { SerialPortStream } = require('@serialport/stream')
const { MockBinding } = require('@serialport/binding-mock')

// Create a port and enable the echo and recording.
MockBinding.createPort('/dev/ROBOT', { echo: true, record: true })
const port = new SerialPortStream({ binding: MockBinding, path: '/dev/ROBOT', baudRate: 14400 })

port.on('open', () => {
  port.port.emitData('pretend data from device')
})
```

It should also be noted that the [`SerialPortMock` class from the `serialport`](api-serialport#serialportmock) package has the `MockBinding` setup for you.

The code can be found in the [`@serialport/binding-mock`](api-binding-mock) package.
