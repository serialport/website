Typescript signature of Abstract Binding

   * is opened, configured and ready for use.

   * @param {openOptions} options openOptions for the serialport
   * @returns {Promise} Resolves after the port is opened and configured.

   * [`fs.read`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_read_fd_buffer_offset_length_position_callback)
   * except it will always return at least one byte.

   * The in progress reads must error when the port is closed with an error object that has the
   * property `canceled` equal to `true`. Any other error will cause a disconnection.

   * @param {buffer} buffer Accepts a [`Buffer`](http://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) object.
   * @param {integer} offset The offset in the buffer to start writing at.
   * @param {integer} length Specifies the maximum number of bytes to read.
   * @returns {Promise} Resolves with the number of bytes read after a read operation.
